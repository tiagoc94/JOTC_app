# Jumping on the clouds app

### Notes:

The user authentication, which will allow access to the admin console, relies on the user's first name. 
Authenticated first names are "admin1" and "admin2".
I chose the first name and not the email, for example, to avoid having to use real emails in the source code while making this repo public.

### Issues:

The table scroll in the admin console doesn't work properly in mobile view.
